# Basics

## Install `FileSetExperiment`

`R` is an open-source statistical environment which can be easily modified to enhance its functionality via packages. `r Biocpkg("FileSetExperiment")` is a `R` package available via the [Bioconductor](http://bioconductor.org) repository for packages. `R` can be installed on any operating system from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) after which you can install `r Biocpkg("FileSetExperiment")` by using the following commands in your `R` session:

```{r "install", eval = FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE)) {
    install.packages("BiocManager")
}

BiocManager::install("FileSetExperiment")

## Check that you have a valid Bioconductor installation
BiocManager::valid()
```

## Required knowledge

`r Biocpkg("FileSetExperiment")` is based on many other packages and in particular in those that have implemented the infrastructure needed for dealing with RNA-seq data (EDIT!). That is, packages like `r Biocpkg("SummarizedExperiment")` (EDIT!).

If you are asking yourself the question "Where do I start using Bioconductor?" you might be interested in [this blog post](http://lcolladotor.github.io/2014/10/16/startbioc/#.VkOKbq6rRuU).

## Asking for help

As package developers, we try to explain clearly how to use our packages and in which order to use the functions. But `R` and `Bioconductor` have a steep learning curve so it is critical to learn where to ask for help. The blog post quoted above mentions some but we would like to highlight the [Bioconductor support site](https://support.bioconductor.org/) as the main resource for getting help: remember to use the `FileSetExperiment` tag and check [the older posts](https://support.bioconductor.org/tag/FileSetExperiment/). Other alternatives are available such as creating GitHub issues and tweeting. However, please note that if you want to receive help you should adhere to the [posting guidelines](http://www.bioconductor.org/help/support/posting-guide/). It is particularly critical that you provide a small reproducible example and your session information so package developers can track down the source of the error.

## Citing `FileSetExperiment`

We hope that `r Biocpkg("FileSetExperiment")` will be useful for your research. Please cite the package accordingly:

( add citation here; using `citation` causes pkgdown errors ) 

# Quick start to using `FileSetExperiment`

```{r start, message=FALSE}
library("FileSetExperiment")
```

# Reproducibility

This package was developed using `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("biocthis")`.

Code for creating the vignette

```{r createVignette, eval=FALSE}
## Create the vignette
library("rmarkdown")
system.time(render("FileSetExperiment.Rmd", "BiocStyle::html_document"))

## Extract the R code
library("knitr")
knit("FileSetExperiment.Rmd", tangle = TRUE)
```

Date the vignette was generated.

```{r reproduce1, echo=FALSE}
## Date the vignette was generated
Sys.time()
```

Wallclock time spent generating the vignette.

```{r reproduce2, echo=FALSE}
## Processing time in seconds
totalTime <- diff(c(startTime, Sys.time()))
round(totalTime, digits = 3)
```

`R` session information.

```{r reproduce3, echo=FALSE}
## Session info
library("sessioninfo")
options(width = 120)
session_info()
```
